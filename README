codeforces-scraper aims to take away some of the boilerplate in competing in
Codeforces (http://codeforces.com/) programming contests.  In particular, it:

(1) Loads the contest page, sees how many problems there are.

(2) Creates a directory structure for the problems (a/ b/ c/ d/ e/).

(3) Loads each problem, parses the example inputs and outputs and saves them
    locally.
